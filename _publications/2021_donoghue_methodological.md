Neural oscillations, crucial for understanding cognitive tasks, require careful analysis due to the complexities of field potential data. This article outlines seven key considerations for their study: <br>
(1) confirming oscillation presence; <br>
(2) accurately defining oscillation bands; <br>
(3) accounting for overlapping aperiodic activity; <br>
(4) addressing temporal variability; <br>
(5) considering non-sinusoidal waveform shape; <br>
(6) distinguishing between spatially overlapping rhythms; and <br>
(7) ensuring a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. <br>
These points are essential for avoiding misinterpretation and improving the reliability of neural oscillation research.
