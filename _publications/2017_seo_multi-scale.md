This study presents a computational model to understand how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates motor cortex pyramidal cells. Using MRI-based head models, it predicts electric field effects on neurons, showing layer 3 pyramidal neurons are more easily stimulated than layer 5. The model also indicates how coil orientation influences cortical activation. This work aids in refining TMS applications in clinical and research contexts.
