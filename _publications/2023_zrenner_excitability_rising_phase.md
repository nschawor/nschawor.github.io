This study explores the relationship between the sensorimotor µ-rhythm and cortical excitability, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG in 52 adults. It examines whether the negative peak of these oscillations corresponds to the highest corticospinal excitability and if this is consistent across individuals. The research found that the highest excitability occurs during the early rising phase of the µ-rhythm, slightly delayed from the negative peak. This phase of highest excitability was consistent among participants and unaffected by different EEG-cleaning methods. The study results, showing consistent phases of highest excitability across individuals using a standard EEG setup, hold promise for clinical applications in personalized brain interventions, particularly in the motor system. Further research is needed to see if similar findings apply to other brain areas and oscillations.
