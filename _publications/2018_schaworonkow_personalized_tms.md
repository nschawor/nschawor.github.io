Combining EEG and TMS, this study explores how ongoing brain activity affects cortical excitability. It compares two methods for extracting brain signals: spatial-spectral decomposition (SSD) and traditional local C3-centered Laplacian filters, focusing on the sensorimotor μ-rhythm. Both extraction methods led to a comparable degree of MEP amplitude modulation by phase of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm at the time of stimulation. This is important for accurately detecting EEG features in real-time, especially in brain regions without established benchmark methods to extract oscillatory phase.
