Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique that enables noninvasive manipulation of neural activity and holds promise in both clinical and basic research settings. The eï¬€ect of TMS on the motor cortex is often measured by electromyography (EMG) recordings from a small hand muscle. However, the details of how TMS generates responses measured with EMG are not completely understood. We aim to develop a biophysically detailed computational model to study the potential mechanisms underlying the generation of EMG signals following TMS.
