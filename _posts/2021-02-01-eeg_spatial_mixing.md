<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the EEG signal is a mixture of many different contributions. for example: midfrontal theta-, sensorimotor mu- and posterior alpha-rhythms, as well as muscle noise &amp; eye blink artifacts. below, these components are added up successively onto electrode signals for illustration. <a href="https://t.co/UcO0Trfn2D">pic.twitter.com/UcO0Trfn2D</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1357962622453248006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
