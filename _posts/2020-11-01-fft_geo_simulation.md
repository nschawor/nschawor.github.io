<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" ><p lang="en" dir="ltr">discrete Fourier transform, illustrated geometrically. for each frequency, the dot product of the signal with a sine as well as a cosine is calculated. the power at that frequency corresponds to the length of the vector that has the 2 dot products as x- and y-entries. <a href="https://t.co/goF0TsO0I5">pic.twitter.com/goF0TsO0I5</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1329502372683423744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
