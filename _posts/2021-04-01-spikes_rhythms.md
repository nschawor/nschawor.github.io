<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">when analyzing LFP &amp; spikes, only few units exhibit spike-field coupling. but there are lots of rhythms in the brain, how do they arise? this toy model here shows that only a small fraction of oscillatory units need to be active in synchrony to result in a discernible rhythm. <a href="https://t.co/edrkUNiG1h">pic.twitter.com/edrkUNiG1h</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1383146160999657472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
