<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" ><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The peak frequency for visual alpha-oscillations is typically between 8 and 12 Hz. So, a person with a peak frequency of 8 Hz will traverse through 480 up and downs per minute, while a person with a 12 Hz peak will traverse through much more, 720. Will it make a difference? ðŸ¤” <a href="https://t.co/N5eJKRL5Tp">pic.twitter.com/N5eJKRL5Tp</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1247423294468263936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
