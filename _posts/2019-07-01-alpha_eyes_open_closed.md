<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" ><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Visual alpha oscillations when eyes are closed versus when eyes are open, recorded with EEG on the scalp surface (broadband filtered).

Very beautiful waveforms! <a href="https://t.co/N3PCXVxqBH">pic.twitter.com/N3PCXVxqBH</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1156623516625592320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
