<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sometimes, there is a notion that oscillations are unspecific compared to high-frequency activity. but for below case of movement-related desynchronization, you can distinguish movement types using post-cue oscillatory power with 100% accuracy, as for high-frequency activity. <a href="https://t.co/SIZDjQQemr">pic.twitter.com/SIZDjQQemr</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Schaworonkow (@nschawor) <a href="https://twitter.com/nschawor/status/1364638980076019713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2021</a></blockquote>
