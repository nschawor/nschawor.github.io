something that I want to add to the next event I am organizing: very cute hand-drawn mini poster previews on the overview that lists all posters 👩‍🎨🎨 (this one is from [@TMS_jedi](https://x.com/TMS_jedi))

& if you want to learn some EEG/MEG analysis, you can already put the planned PracticalMEEG event in October 2025 in your calendar. 🙂
